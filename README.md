TASKS 1 : CGPA CALCULATOR
       A CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator is a tool designed to compute the overall academic performance of a student across multiple subjects or semesters. 
      It simplifies the process by taking into account the grades achieved in individual subjects and their corresponding credit values. 

The calculator works as follows:
1. **Input Grades and Credits**: Enter the grade points (e.g., 10 for an A) and credit hours for each subject.
2. **Weighted Scores**: Multiply each grade point by its respective credit hours to get the weighted score for that subject.
3. **Sum Up**: Add all the weighted scores to get the total grade points.
4. **Divide**: Divide the total grade points by the sum of credit hours for all subjects to get the CGPA.


TASKS 2: LOGIN AND REGISTRATION SYSTEM

 **Login**: Provides access to an account or system by verifying credentials
     (e.g., username and password). It ensures security and personalized access.
 **Registration**: Allows a user to create a new account by providing necessary information
     (e.g., name, email, password). Once registered, users can log in to access their accounts.
